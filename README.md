Repository for Arsenic And Lace plugin for Simple Ores, by akkamaddi, maintained by Sinhika.

Minecraft 1.17.1 port of akkamaddi's Simple Arsenic and Old Lace mod

TO-DO
-----
* ~~FIRST: Convert to 1.17.1 ~~
* Add chance of zombies and other undead wearing Old Lace shrouds.
* (akkamaddi) arsenic ore block, spawns in a narrow band and very rare.  
	"*I was thinking of adding an arsenic ore block. Fusion based ores are advantageous because they don't rely on world generation, but it would be a logical way to "explain" where all the undead arsenic comes from. I was planning on having it in a narrow band (height 16 to 32 or so), with generation stats like Onyx or Cthon, so it would be more of a novelty than something actively hunted. (It would still mainly come from throwing monsters in the juicer.)*"
* (akkamaddi) Tainted Furnace, fueled by undead bits (Rotten Flesh, Bones); randomly generates (25%) additional output of Toxic Soot that can be combined to form Toxic Lump/Sludge/etc, to be smelted into Arsenic nugget. 
	"*Because all the cool kids were making furnaces, I was thinking about a Tainted Furnace. It would be a basic furnace with a second output in the lower corner. It would run on necromantic energy. Rotten Flesh and Bones would smelt eight items, and bone meal would smelt one item. (A Shroud could fuel 64 item smeltings.) Each smelted item would have a 25% chance of generating one Toxic Soot in the lower output. Toxic Soot items would be combined to a Toxic Lump (Sludge?), which could then be smelted into a Small Arsenic Chunk. It may have "dark energy" like the Onyx Furnace, but only double items 5% of the time. This would let people with massive stores of zombie flesh use it as a useful fuel, while providing a slow trickle of arsenic for alloys. Also, cooking food in an arsenic furnace over zombie flesh releasing its necromantic energy gives it a lovely roasted almond flavor, and is great for weight loss diets as your fingers and toes fall off. ;-)*"
* For Tainted Furnace: cooking food in it turns it poisonous. Potatoes => poisonous potato, meat => Rotten Flesh, disallow other food recipes?
* Add French & Spanish language files.
* add ingots of lower-end metals to loot tables. tools or armor?
* Add Silent Gear support (data and model files for materials)
* Add shears for metals.
* add config strings to language files.
